\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}
I use administrative data from the Statistics Denmark.\footnote{All code available at \textcolor{red}{HERE}. I make heavy use of \href{https://github.com/pola-rs/polars}{Polars} (\textcite{polars_ritchie_vink_2025} \& \textcite{polars_grouper_van_eechoud}) to process the data. Some steps involves manipulating datasets with several billion rows and \href{https://github.com/pola-rs/polars}{Polars} allows to do this efficiently and in parallel. I thank the developers for making this excellent library.} The level of unit I focus on is \textit{households} (maybe specify why). In the following section, I go through the data used in the paper and how I constructed the households.

\subsection{Geospatial}
\label{sec:data_geospatial}
The main dataset I use is \boldsf{BOPAEL\_KOORD}. This dataset contains all historic addresses in four dimensions:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{p} = (x_E, y_N, z_F, z_D)
\end{equation}

\noindent
Where $\textbf{p}$ is a tuple of x/y/z-coordinates, where subscripts denote east, north, floor and door, respectively, in the ETRS89-projection. This projection is specifically tailored to Northern Europe such that distances between coordinates, whether these are Manhattan or euclidean, are measured in meters. Crucially, the dataset contain both the start and end date of residency at those coordinates. These are derived administrative data, where individuals report their main address. Thus, in effect, the outcome of "moving" is synonymous with a "change in address". 

A key component of my identification strategy is that I specify which \textit{neighborhood} a household lives in at a given point in time. This is parameterized by $\omega_{j,t}$ in (\ref{eq:main_eq_schelling_behavior}). There exists no clear consensus of what constitutes a neighborhood in the geopgrahical sense. For instance, I could use administrative borders such as municipalities or parishes. However, I believe there is a number of issues by doing this. First, municipalities are way too large to elicit salient social interactions and, second, I believe parishes to have borders that are too inconsistently drawn.\footnote{In 2024, the sizes of parishes ranged between less than 100 to over 20,000 (\textcite{dst_sogn_stats}).} I rely on work by \textcite{nabolagsatlas_neighborhoods_boje2023}, who use the Danish Kvadratnet, a graphical representation of Denmark as squares down to the 100m-by-100m level, to delineate "fixed" neighborhoods as polygons that contain at least 100 inhabitants. To do this, they apply a heuristic version of the MaxP-regionalization algorithm by \textcite{maxp_heuristic_wei2021efficient}. Because I fear that the outcome of moving in may be relative sparse in some areas, I elect to further aggregate this to the level of a minimum 500 inhabitants to strike a balance between variation and salient social interactions. 


\subsection{Nearest neighbors}
With the definition of households and geospatial dataset in mind, I turn to the identification of nearest neighbors. From $\mathbf{p}$, I construct a KD-tree (\textcite{bentley1975multidimensional}) of all unique addresses (that is all unique 4-dimensional combinations within $\mathbf{p}$). More formally, a KD-tree is a space-partitioning data structure that organizes points in a $k$-dimensional space. In my application, $k=4$, corresponding to the 4-dimensional point representation in $\mathbf{p}$. I can then query nearest neighbors, either specifying the ordinal rank $K$, which is what I elect to focus on, or within a radius $r$.

The nearest neighbor query procedure for a point $q \in \mathbb{R}^4$ involves traversing the tree to find the $K$ nearest points according to a specified distance metric. I employ the Euclidean ($L_2$-norm) distance in this 4-dimensional space:

\begin{equation}
d(p_i, p_j) = \sqrt{\sum_{d=1}^{4} (p_i^d - p_j^d)^2}
\end{equation}

where $p_i^d$ represents the $d$-th dimension of point $p_i$. Because not all addresses exist for the same amount of time (new homes are built or old ones torn down), I make sure to "buffer" extra addresses by widening my search space. 


\subsection{Households}
Given the richness of the data, I need to carefully define what constitutes a "household". To do this, I borrow from the graph theory literature. Define individuals as nodes and spatio-temporal overlap as edges. Edges exist only if people overlap in time and space. For $N$ number of sequences, define the $N \times N$ adjacency matrix $\mathbf{A}_{i,j}$:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{A}_{i,j} = \begin{cases}
        w_{i,j} & \text{if people overlap in time and space} \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Weights are determined by:

\begin{equation}
    w_{i, j} = \frac{\max(0 , \min(t_{i,end}, t_{j, end}) -\max(t_{i,start}-t_{j, start}))}{t_{i,end}-t_{i,start}} + \mathbb{I}[i=j=G]
    \label{eq:edge_weights}
\end{equation}

The first part of (\ref{eq:edge_weights}) expresses how much sequence $i$ overlapped with sequence $j$ as a fraction of duration of sequence $i$. The second part is an indicator function to flag if the two sequences are part of the same group $G$, be it as family or as partners.

Consider the fact that not all members of a household may move out around the same time, which further complicates credible identification of "Schelling behavior". For example, suppose person A and person B moves in at the same time in a home. Person A moves out just before B, but a person C moves into the home and lives with person B for a short amount of time, before B moves out. Linking the sequences together, or in graph theory terms identifying \textit{connected components}, would yield a single household of A, B and C, when it most intuitively makes sense to have A and B as one household and C as another. 

To formalize this approach, I use administrative registers as an intermediate to evaluate different "household partitions".\footnote{Specifically, I make use of the \boldsf{familie\_id} variable from the \boldsf{BEF} table that maps groups of people that live at the same address, see \textcite{dst_familie_id}.} Maximizing edge weights defined in (\ref{eq:edge_weights}), scaled by the size the household partition, is what I define a "household" as. Consider Figure \ref{fig:temporal_community_detection} as an illustration of this approach. Maximizing edge weights would yield three different "stable" households instead of one.
\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Household definition}
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{figs/temporal_community_detection.png}
    \label{fig:temporal_community_detection}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Administrative data}
I further enrich my data from administrative sources. Specifcally, I use the table \boldsf{BEF} to fetch fundamental background variables, such as birth date (\boldsf{foed\_dag}), parental info (\boldsf{mor\_id} \& \boldsf{far\_id}), country of origin (\boldsf{opr\_land}) and partner identifier (\boldsf{aegte\_pid} / \boldsf{e\_faelle\_pid}). This is combined with table \boldsf{IND} from which I extract gross income (\boldsf{perindkialt\_13}), which includes both cash transfer and wages, and net wealth (without pension) (\textcolor{red}{\boldsf{form}}). Additionally, I extract employment status (\boldsf{beskst13}) from the \boldsf{RAS} table. Finally, I also include highest obtained education level (\boldsf{hfaudd}) from table \boldsf{UDDF}.\footnote{I specifically categorize education according to the DISCED-15 classification, see \textcite{dst_disced_edu}.}

\subsection{Estimation sample}
\label{sec:estimation_sample_definition}
I impose a number of restrictions on the sample of households to build my estimation sample. First, I drop households with gross real yearly incomes below 200,000 DKK and above 1,500,000 DKK. In similar vein, I keep household that have real net wealth (excluding pensions) between -200,000 DKK and 500,000 DKK. I further require that the oldest member of the household is between 30 and 60. These restrictions weeds out instances where members of households may be studying or outside the labor market.  

Next, I restrict my analysis to native and non-West households, following the definition set out in section \ref{sec:intro_definitions}. This choice is mainly drive by the historic fact that Denmark has undergone a transition from a relatively homogenously ethnic society to one with a significantly larger share of people with non-West origins. In 1985, around 1 pct. of people had non-West origin, which grew to around 9 pct. in 2020. This increase has sparked tension and, like with most other European countries, an increase in support for anti-immigration policies (cite). I drop "Western" households in my analysis as previous evidence (cite) mainly points to residential segregation between non-Western immigrants and native households.

Furthermore, I require that the nearest neighbor to a household is within 25 meters. This is to ensure that social interactions between new different-type neighbors are more likely to take place. I present evidence of why this assumption is reasonable in Table \ref{}, as household have limited response to a new different-type nearest neighbor beyond 25 meters. In addition, I focus on neighborhoods with a population between 1,000 and 25,000 people per square kilometers. 

\subsection{Summary statistics}
Figure \ref{fig:incidence_different_type_dk} depicts the incidence of new different-type neighbors among your $K=40$ nearest neighbors for native households split by municipality since 1985. Unsurprisingly, major cities (Copenhagen, Aarhus and Odense) are commonly represented in the sample. On average, each household experience between 4-6 new different-type neighbors during their residence. Interestingly, it is not any of the major cities with highest avg. incidence. It is in fact in Ishøj, where the average household experience over 9 new different-type neighbors among their $K=40$ nearest neighbors. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Incidence of new different-type neighbors at the national level}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/dk_howdy_neighbor.pdf}
    \label{fig:incidence_different_type_dk}
\begin{tablenotes}
\item \footnotesize \textit{Note:} The figure show the variation in receiving a new-non West neighbors for native households split by municipality. Municipal borders correspond to the ones imposed by "Kommunalreformen" in 2007.  Household types are split up in three types (native/non-West/West), see section \ref{sec:intro_definitions} for more details. Neighborhoods are defined in section \ref{sec:data_geospatial}.
\end{tablenotes}
\end{figure}

However, Figure \ref{fig:incidence_different_type_dk} hides the great variation in the incidence of new different-type neighbors that exists at the very local scale. Figure \ref{fig:incidence_different_type_neighborhood} shows the incidence of new different-type neighbors across neighborhoods in three different cities/municipalities since 1985 as defined in section \ref{sec:data_geospatial}. Residents in some neighborhoods in Copenhagen get upwards of 30 new non-West neighbors during their residence, while other neighborhoods get less than 2. The same goes for Aarhus, where the average native resident in some neighborhoods get more than 15 new different-type neighbors.

\newpage
Table \ref{tab:descriptives_native_and_non_west} presents summary statistics for the two samples of Native and non-Western households as defined in section \ref{sec:estimation_sample_definition}. Columns \textit{All} describe each quarter-by-year observations for a given household where all covariates are observed in the period between 1985 and 2020 and where household may be "at-risk" of receiving a new different-type neighbor. Columns \textit{Nearest} and \textit{Close} each describe the year-by-quarter observations, where a household experience a new different-type neighbor either as their nearest neighbor ($K\in [1,2, 3]$) or as their "close" neighbor ($K \in [4,5, ..., 40]$).

Table \ref{tab} reveals an intriguing pattern in the first row across both panels. "Treated" households (both native and non-Western) demonstrate a notably higher likelihood of relocating within the following two years after gaining a different-type neighbor—23-24 percent compared to 19-20 percent for their "control" counterparts. However, a critical consideration for this analysis is that this apparent "Schelling" response could be influenced by various confounding factors, including changes in neighborhood quality or selection effects. This observation underscores the value of employing the nearest neighbor research design, which helps address these potential confounders.

The following rows reveal that treated native households are considerably less wealthy than the full sample of native households (48,000 DKK vs 81,000 DKK) in addition to earning less (336,000 DKK vs 343,000 DKK), but that this difference, though still relatively large, is less between the "treated" and "control" native households. The differences in income and wealth between treated, control and the full sample of Non-Western households are less pronounced, though at levels lower than their native counterparts.

Interestingly, non-Western households in the sample are on average better educated (defined as the person in the households with the longest education) than native households. Likewise, treated non-Western households are more educated than control non-Western households, a pattern opposite that of native households. Furthermore, non-Western household are bigger in size and younger than native households. 

Table \ref{tab:descriptives_native_and_non_west} also highlights some striking patterns regarding the neighborhood characteristics. First, the neighborhoods in which these experiments happen tend to be concentrated in relatively dense and more integrated neighborhoods. For instance, non-Western households as a whole live in considerably denser neighborhoods than their native counterparts. Second, and perhaps an indication of "Schelling" behavior in and of itself, native households as a whole tend to live in less dense, more affluent and less-integrated neighborhoods. For instance, treated native households live in much denser neighborhoods with double the share of non-Western households (15 percent) compared to the whole sample of native households (8 percent).

\end{table}

\subsection{KNN over time}
When describing the data, I have mostly employed a "static" view of the time period, which negates any potential underlying trend of spatial sorting. I try to rectify this in Figure \ref{fig:temporal_development_knn} that shows the development of the K-nearest neighbors from 1990-2020.

Going from left-to-right, it shows the share of same type neighbors going your $K=5$ up to $K=100$ nearest neighbors.

\subsection{Balance test}

Before diving into the main results, I perform a series of balance tests to determine any potential (mean) differences between the "control" and "treatment" group. Consider the following equation:

\begin{equation}
    X_{i, j, t} = \phi_1 \mathbb{I}[r', k=n_{nearest}] + \phi_2 \mathbb{I}[r', k = n_{near}] + \phi_3 \mathbb{I}[r', k = n_{close}] + \omega_{j, t} + \epsilon_{i, j, t} 
    \label{eq:balance_tests}
\end{equation}
Where $X$ is observables at the household and individual level Eq. (\ref{eq:balance_tests}) is exactly the same as Eq. (\ref{eq:main_eq_schelling_behavior}). 

\begin{table}[H]
