Sample of ~200,000 households of ethnically Danish origin (all household members are of Danish ethnicity) from 2017-2019 who earn from DKK 100,000 to 1,500,000 DKK. They \textit{all} at some point experience getting a new non-west neighbor (defined as a household with at least one member from non-west origin). Apart from neighborhood-by-quarter FE, no further controls are added. Given that people are in a state of flow, I have devised a "stable" definition of a household.
