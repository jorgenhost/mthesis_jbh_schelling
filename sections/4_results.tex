Sample of ~200,000 households of ethnically Danish origin (all household members are of Danish ethnicity) from 2017-2019 who earn from DKK 100,000 to 1,500,000 DKK. They \textit{all} at some point experience getting a new non-west neighbor (defined as a household with at least one member from non-west origin). Apart from neighborhood-by-quarter FE, no further controls are added. Given that people are in a state of flow, I have devised a "stable" definition of a household.

Borrowing from the graph theory literature, I first identify connected components, or individuals, who overlap in space and time. However, this only gives me transitive connections (example), so I have devised an algorithm (?) that uses \textbf{familie\_id} from the \textbf{BEF} table to define the "best" partition. This is done via calculating temporal and social (whether you are partners or parents/children) edge weights and subsequently maximize these. To illustrate, consider the figure below that illustrates this approach. A connected component definition of a household would define the whole graph as a single household. Maximizing edge weights would yield three different "stable" households instead of one.
