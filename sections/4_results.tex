Table \ref{tab:main_results_native} and \ref{tab:main_results_non_west} report estimates $\beta_1-\beta_2$ from equation \ref{eq:main_eq_schelling_behavior} as proxy for Schelling behavior. All columns include neighborhood-by-quarter fixed effects ($\omega_{j,t}$ from equation \ref{eq:main_eq_schelling_behavior}) to facilitate comparable analysis. The first column has no further covariates added. 

For native households, the estimate indicate an increase in moving propensity of 0.9 percentage points if a native households gets a new non-west neighbor among their nearest neighbor than among their $K=[11-20]$-nearest neighbor. As expected from the balance tests, however, this effect dampens if we add control variables for real equivalised income, tenure and the age of oldest household member in succession. The preferred specification in column 4 indicate an incremental moving response of 0.7 percentage points. 

For non-Western households, estimates of Schelling behavior remain at lower levels than that of their native counterparts. For the same ordinal neighbor rank, the estimate of my preferred specification in column 4 indicate Schelling behavior that are about half as intense for non-Western households as it is for native households. 

If we compare these estimates to the mean of the dependent variable across the different types of household, these translate to an increase in moving propensity of $\frac{0.7}{20} = 3.5$ pct. for native households and $\frac{0.36}{20}=1.8$ pct. for non-Western households within 2 years.
